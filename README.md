# Red Flag Dating Profile Analyzer

Welcome to the digital wasteland. This is the tool for anyone sick of swiping through the same recycled lies, gym selfies, and "adventure" clichés. If you want corporate buzzwords, go back to LinkedIn. If you want the truth (and maybe a little trauma), keep reading.

## What This Actually Does (No Fluff)

- **Profile Dissection**: Paste a dating profile or upload a screenshot. Our highly-advanced slut/sociopath algo will rip it apart and tell you what’s really going on behind the curated nonsense.
- **Chat Autopsy**: Drop in your DMs or chat logs. We’ll flag the manipulation, the ghosting patterns, and the red flags you keep ignoring.
- **Compatibility Reality Check**: Forget “you both like dogs.” We score based on substance, not surface-level BS. If you’re a walking red flag, we’ll tell you that too.
- **Generational Warfare**: See how the cringe changes from Boomers to Gen Z. Spoiler: everyone’s lying, just in different fonts.
- **Final Verdict**: Get a summary that doesn’t sugarcoat. If it stings, good. That means it’s working.
- **Demo Mode**: Paranoid? Test it with fake data. We don’t care.
- **Export the Carnage**: Save your results or send them to your group chat for a roast session.

## Why? Because Dating Apps Are a Joke

You’re not finding love. You’re dodging scams, bots, and people who peaked in high school. This app is your digital lie detector, built by someone who’s seen enough after-hours NYC chaos to know a red flag when it’s waving.

## Tech Stack (For the Paranoid & the Nerds)

- React, TypeScript, Vite (because we’re not animals)
- Tailwind CSS (for the hot pink glow)
- Supabase (because Firebase is for sellouts)
- Claude AI (for the analysis, not the therapy)
- Custom pattern-matching that doesn’t care about your feelings

## Install & Run (If You Can Read)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How To Use (Don’t Overthink It)

1. Paste a profile or upload a screenshot.
2. Hit analyze. Wait a few seconds. Go get a drink.
3. Read the results. Laugh, cry, or rage-quit dating.
4. Share the pain with friends, or ignore the advice and repeat your mistakes. Up to you.

## How It Works (The Short Version)

Pattern recognition, AI, and a healthy dose of cynicism. We look for:
- Contradictions and copy-paste interests
- Manipulation tactics and ghosting red flags
- Actual compatibility (not just “likes pizza”)
- Conversation patterns that scream “run”
