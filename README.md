# Red Flag Dating Profile Analyzer

Analyzes dating profiles and conversations to identify potential red flags and compatibility issues. Built because dating apps are full of BS and people need better tools to avoid wasting time.

## What It Does

Scans dating profiles and chat logs for:
- Inconsistencies in stated interests vs actual knowledge
- Communication red flags and manipulation patterns  
- Compatibility scoring based on actual substance
- Real interest validation vs surface-level claims

No fancy marketing BS - just pattern recognition applied to dating profiles.

## Features

- **Profile Analysis**: Upload screenshots or paste text from dating profiles
- **Chat Analysis**: Analyze conversation patterns for red flags
- **Compatibility Scoring**: Get actual compatibility metrics
- **Demo Mode**: Test with sample data if you don't want to upload real profiles
- **Export Results**: Save analysis results as PDF or share via link

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase for backend/database
- Claude AI for profile analysis
- Custom pattern matching algorithms

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Usage

1. Upload a dating profile screenshot or paste profile text
2. Wait for AI analysis (takes 10-30 seconds)
3. Review red flags, compatibility score, and recommendations
4. Use the insights to make better dating decisions

## How It Works

The analyzer uses pattern recognition to identify:
- Inconsistencies between claimed interests and actual knowledge depth
- Communication patterns that indicate manipulation or dishonesty
- Compatibility factors based on actual substance vs surface-level attractions
- Warning signs in conversation flow and response patterns

Not perfect, but better than going in blind.
