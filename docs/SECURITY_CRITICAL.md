# Critical Security Considerations

## High-Priority Vulnerabilities

### Database Access
- Misconfigured RLS policies can expose ALL user data
- Service role key exposure grants full database access
- Unvalidated direct table operations bypass RLS
- Public bucket access can expose private files

### Authentication
- Disabled email verification allows account spoofing
- Reused JWT secrets compromise all tokens
- Missing session invalidation enables persistence
- Weak password policies permit credential stuffing

### API Security  
- Unauthenticated edge functions expose internal operations
- Missing rate limiting enables DoS attacks
- Unvalidated file uploads allow arbitrary execution
- Exposed environment variables compromise secrets

## Protection Strategies

### Database Hardening
- Audit and test ALL RLS policies
- Rotate service role keys regularly
- Validate operations through middleware
- Implement strict bucket policies

### Auth Strengthening  
- Enforce email verification
- Use unique JWT secrets
- Implement session management
- Require strong passwords

### API Fortification
- Authenticate ALL edge functions
- Apply strict rate limits
- Validate file uploads
- Secure environment variables

## Security Checklist

### Critical Priorities
- [ ] Audit RLS policies
- [ ] Rotate service keys
- [ ] Verify auth flows
- [ ] Test API security
- [ ] Monitor for threats

### Regular Maintenance  
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Update dependencies
- [ ] Patch vulnerabilities
- [ ] Backup critical data
- [ ] Test recovery plans

## Monitoring & Response

### Watch For
- Unusual query patterns
- Failed auth attempts
- API abuse signals
- Resource spikes
- Error increases

### Response Steps
1. Identify threat source
2. Isolate affected systems
3. Revoke compromised access
4. Patch vulnerabilities
5. Restore secure state

## Best Practices

### Development
- Use prepared statements
- Validate all input
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Log security events
- Test edge cases

### Deployment
- Secure configuration
- Minimal permissions
- Regular updates
- Access monitoring
- Incident planning
